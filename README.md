# Main Points
* **Scraping Process** : Scraping done primarily using Github REST API resources online discourse and ChatGPT assistance. After scraping, data was cleaned to create users.csv and repositories.csv
* **Interesting Observations**: Created a presence-rating(look at analyisis.ipynb)to find top 10 companies based on presence. Interestingly,I found that VERCEL has the highest presence with Google at 2nd. Microsoft is at 7th. Also,people who are not interested in recruiter mails(indicating stable developers) also have a healthy presence at 9th spot.
* **Recommendation to Developers** : JavaScript is by far the most popular language among users of the Top 5 companies in Berlin. So, to increase the number of followers developers can focus on JavaScript related projects on Github.

Look at analysis.ipynb for vizualization regarding the above-mentioned analysis.
